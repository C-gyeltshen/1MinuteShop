# Subdomain Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement subdomain support for user shops in the project. After user registration, each user's shop will be hosted live on a unique subdomain (e.g., `username.example.com`).

---

## Goals

- Assign a unique subdomain to each user upon registration.
- Deploy the user's shop to their subdomain immediately after registration.
- Ensure subdomains are live and accessible.
- Handle subdomain conflicts and validation.

---

## Steps

### 1. Subdomain Generation

- On user registration, generate a subdomain based on the username or a unique identifier.
- Validate the subdomain to ensure it meets DNS and project requirements (e.g., no special characters, not a reserved word).

### 2. DNS & Routing Configuration

- Use a wildcard DNS entry (`*.example.com`) pointing to the project server.
- Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application router to resolve requests to the correct shop based on the subdomain.

### 3. Shop Deployment

- After registration, automatically create a shop instance for the user.
- Deploy the shop and associate it with the generated subdomain.
- Ensure the shop is accessible at `subdomain.example.com`.

### 4. Database Changes

- Add a `subdomain` field to the user/shop model.
- Store and index the subdomain for efficient lookup.

### 5. Conflict Handling

- Check for subdomain uniqueness during registration.
- Handle cases where the desired subdomain is already taken.

### 6. Security

- Implement SSL/TLS for all subdomains (wildcard certificate or automated certificate provisioning).
- Validate subdomain requests to prevent host header attacks.

### 7. Testing

- Test subdomain creation, routing, and shop deployment.
- Verify accessibility and security of each subdomain.

## Example Flow

1. User registers with username `alice`.
2. System generates subdomain `alice.example.com`.
3. Shop is deployed and live at `alice.example.com` immediately after registration.

---

## Future Considerations

- Allow users to customize their subdomain.
- Support for custom domains.
- Monitoring and analytics per subdomain.
